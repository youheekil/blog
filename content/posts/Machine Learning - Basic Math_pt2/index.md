> Machine learning is nothing but a geometry problem ! All data is the same. Understanding geometry is very important to solve machine learning problems. 

## [Numpy] Basic Linear Algebra

`Linear algebra`, mathematical discipline that deals with **vectors** and **matrices** and, more generally, with **vector spaces** and **linear transformations**  ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/linear-algebra))


In this lecture, you will learn 

1. Scala, Vector, Array, Tensor 
2. Dot product & Norm
3. Multiplication & Transpose & Invertible matrix
**4. Linear Transformation**
**5. Eigen Value & Eigen Vector**
**6. Cosine Similarity**


and perform these with `Numpy`

### 4. Linear Transformation 

Linear Transformations are often used in machine learning applications. 


### 5. Eigen Value & Eigen Vector 
### 6. Cosine Similarity
