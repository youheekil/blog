**Unsupervised Learning** refers an approach within maching learning that takes in **unlabeled** examples and produces patterns from the provided data. Typically, the goal is to discover something previously unknown about the unlabled examples. 

The popular unsupervised learning tasks are

* Clustering ‚≠ê
* Dimensionality Reduction 
* Anomaly Detection 
* Density Estimation 
* Association Rule Learning

## K-means
## Singular Vector Decomposition
