# Design Patterns
`Design Patterns` are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.

It is more like a general concept to solve a particular problem rather than a piece of code. Then, it can be confusing to clearly distinguish the differences between algorithm and design patterns. If an algorithm is like a solving mathematics problem: defines a clear set of actions to solve the problem/achieve the goal, on the other hand, mathematics is like a studying of patterns which gives an opportunity to observe, hypothesise, experiment, discover and create. By studying patterns, people came up with proven and established solution approaches to specific math problems which is similar to design patterns in software development. 

| Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during the software development, but these solutions were obtained by numerous trials and error by software developer for long time. - [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/design_pattern_overview.htm)

Therefore, `learning design patterns` is important. First, saving time for solving problems in software design. Since design pattern is a toolkit of tried and tested solutions, you can solve many kinds of problems with this toolkit using principles of object-oriented design. Second, easier communication among software developers. Instead of explaining what would be the best solution to the problem, you can say, "use a Singleton for that".

There are three categories of design patterns, (1) creational patterns, (2) structural patterns, (3) behavioral patterns.


## Facade Method 

IsÂ a Structural Design pattern that provides a simpler unified interface to a more complex system.
